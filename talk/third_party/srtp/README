Secure RTP (SRTP) Reference Implementation

This package provides an implementation of the Secure Real-time
Transport Protocol (SRTP), the Universal Security Transform (UST), and
a supporting cryptographic kernel.  These mechanisms are documented in
the Internet Drafts in the doc/ subdirectory.  The SRTP API is
documented in include/srtp.h, and the library is in libsrtp.a (after
compilation).  An overview and reference manual is available in
doc/libsrtp.pdf.  The PDF documentation is more up to date than this
file.
